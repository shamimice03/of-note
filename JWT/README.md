# Authentication and Authorization
Authentication verifies the identity of a user or service, and authorization determines their access rights.

 JWT is used for authorization, not authentication. Authentication verifies the username and password, 
 while authorization ensures that the user making the request is authorized to access a specific system.
 
ðŸ’¡ Traditional session-based authorization uses cookies and session IDs stored on the server to authenticate and authorize users.

## What will happen if session DB is down?

ðŸ’¡ JWT, on the other hand, uses a JSON web token to handle authorization. The token contains user information and is sent back to the client upon successful authentication.

ðŸ’¡ The JWT is stored on the client side (e.g., in a cookie) instead of the server, eliminating the need for server-side storage.

ðŸ’¡ When a client makes a request, it includes the JWT for authentication, and the server verifies the token's integrity by checking its signature.

ðŸ’¡ JWT tokens consist of three parts: header, payload, and signature. The header contains information about the token's algorithm and type, the payload stores user data, and the signature ensures the token's integrity.

ðŸ’¡ JWT offers flexibility and scalability since the same token can be used across multiple servers without the need for centralized session storage.
