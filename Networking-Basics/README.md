### Subnet Mask
- A subnet mask is a number that distinguishes the network address and the host address within an IP address. 
- A subnet is a smaller network within a network that requires a subnet mask. 
- Subnetting is the process of dividing a network into two or more subnets.
It's the Subnet mask which allows a HOST to determine if an IP address it needs to communicate with local or remote - which influences if it needs to use gateway
or can communicate locally.
