# OSI Model
The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a conceptual framework that describes the communication functions of a telecommunication or computer system. The model is divided into seven layers, each of which performs a specific function in the transmission of data between networked devices. These layers are designed to provide a standardized approach to network communication, allowing different types of devices to communicate with each other regardless of their underlying hardware or software. By understanding the functions of each layer in the OSI model, network engineers and IT professionals can design, implement, and troubleshoot complex networks more efficiently and effectively.

## Physical layer:
The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a framework that describes the functions and interactions of computer systems in a network. It is divided into seven layers, with each layer responsible for specific functions in data transmission. Layer 1, also known as the physical layer, is the first and lowest layer in the OSI model. It is responsible for the physical transmission of data over a communication channel, such as a wire, cable, or wireless signal. This layer defines the physical characteristics of the communication medium, including voltage levels, cable types, and signaling methods, to ensure that data is transmitted accurately and reliably between devices. In this lesson, we will explore the functions and protocols of Layer 1 in detail to understand how it enables communication between devices in a network.

## Data Link layer:
Layer 2, the data link layer, is responsible for reliable data transfer between nodes on the same network segment.
